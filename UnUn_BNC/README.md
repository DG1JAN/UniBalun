#UnUnBalun

Based on the UniBalun design you will find here a special version for the most requested configuration. With this PCB you can build a QRP UnUn (1:49, 1:64 but also 1:9) with a BNC socket. 

In comparison to the UniBalun, the second Port (A Site) is used as Ground. So you can easily use a counterpoise or earth spike (e.g for you 1:9).
