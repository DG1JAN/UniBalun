Depending on the winding of the toroid, you can use the PCB to create a 1:1 or 1:4 Balun or a 1:49 UnUn.

1:1 Balun: solder a wire-jumper between Pad 1 and 3. No capaciator.

1:4 Balun: solder a wire-jumper between Pad 1 and 2 and another jumper between Pad 3 and 4. No capaciator.

1:49 Unun: solder a wire-jumper between Pad 1 and 4. Solder the capaciator to C1
