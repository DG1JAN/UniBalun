Depending on the winding of the toroid, you can use the PCB to create a 1:1 or 1:4 Balun or a 1:49 UnUn.

1:1 Balun: solder a wire-jumper between Pad 1 and 3. No capaciator.

1:4 Balun: solder a wire-jumper between Pad 1 and 2 and another jumper between Pad 3 and 4. No capaciator.

1:49 Unun: solder a wire-jumper between Pad 1 and 4. Solder the capaciator to C1

As torroid, I'm using "Würth 74270118" but other cores like Amidnon FT82-43 will work as well.

After a request from an OM, I also did a version using a BNC connector. (Amphenol B6252H7, Telegärtner J01001A0038 or similar)
(Be aware, this PCB is untested yet from my site)

For German/EU-Based Hams, I can recommend https://aisler.net/ for PCB manufactiring. You can upload the Kicad file and order the PCBs.
Please selcet the Surface Finish: "ENIG"  for best results (Perfect Gold / Nickel surface finish with excellent planarity).
